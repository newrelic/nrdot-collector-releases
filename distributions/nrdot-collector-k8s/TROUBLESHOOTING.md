# Troubleshooting for nrdot-collector-k8s

For general NRDOT troubleshooting, see [this guide](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md). This document assumes you are familiar with
the troubleshooting tools mentioned. The following list of issues is provided for reference only and without any guarantee. For official support, please refer to the [nr-k8s-otel-collector](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector) helm chart which addresses these issues out-of-the-box.

## Known issues

### No `root_path` in containerized environments
Same solution as in the [nrdot-collector-host troubleshooting guide](../nrdot-collector-host/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#no-root_path-in-containerized-environments) applies.

### Missing permissions
There are many variations of this error due to all the different APIs the k8s components scrape. This is a log example indicating this issue:
```
  reflector.go:569] k8s.io/client-go@v0.32.2/tools/cache/reflector.go:251: failed to list *v1.Node: nodes is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:demo-3:default" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```
The collector is missing permissions to access the cluster-internal k8s APIs. 
As mentioned in the [installation instructions](./README.md), we highly recommend NOT using this distro by itself but rather through our [helm-chart](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector) which sets up the required permissions for you. Otherwise, you will have to consult the documentation of the k8s receivers enabled in the configuration you are running. The error message unfortunately does not mention which component is causing the issue, so you will have to deduce from the 'resource' and 'scope' in the error message which receiver is causing the issue. As an example, the [k8seventsreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/k8seventsreceiver/README.md#service-account) has a section about setting up a `ServiceAccount` with the required permissions.
